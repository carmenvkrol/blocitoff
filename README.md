blocitoff app
=============

Single-page app built with [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/), [Express](http://expressjs.com/), [Mongoose](http://mongoosejs.com/), and [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) using the [Yeoman Angular scaffolding](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular).

Users can create an account in which they add tasks and delete them when completed.  The tasks will self-destruct after 7 days if not completed.


Configuration
------------
Configuring this project should be consistent across Mac (local) and Vagrant.  You should already have [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) and [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/) installed before cloning.

Start by cloning the repository
```
$ git clone https://github.com/carmenvkrol/blocitoff.git
```

This app uses [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) to run tasks.  Install the Grunt Command Line Interface (`grunt-cli`) locally on your machine.
```
$ npm install -g grunt-cli
```

Once that's complete, install the remaining dependencies, except Bower, by running
```
$ npm install
```

Then install the package manager [Bower](http://bower.io/) by running:
```
$ bower install
```


Running the Application
------------
Three tabs must be open in the terminal in order to run this application.

In the first tab, run

```
$ mongod
```

In the second tab, run

```
$ npm start
```

In the last tab, run

```
$ grunt serve
```

The application runs on port 1337 (configured in [Gruntfile.js](https://github.com/carmenvkrol/blocitoff/blob/master/Gruntfile.js)).  To change the port, modify the number highlighted below
```
...
 connect: {
      options: {
        port: 1337, // change this value to the desired port number
        // Change this to '0.0.0.0' to access the server from outside.
        hostname: 'localhost',
        livereload: 35729
      },
...

```


Directory Structure and Grunt
------------
```
blocitoff/
 |__.tmp/
 |__app/ #client-side development and server-side files
 |__bower_components/
 |__dist/ #client-side production files
 |__node_modules/
 |__test/
 Gruntfile.js
 index.js/ #core server-side file

```

Grunt looks for files using a defined pattern so that it knows what to compile and copy and where to put it. To edit the files that Grunt watches, look at the array of files in the watch task in [Gruntfile.js](https://github.com/carmenvkrol/blocitoff/blob/master/Gruntfile.js). The default watched files are:

```
watch: {
  bower: {
    files: ['bower.json'],
    tasks: ['wiredep']
  },
  js: {
    files: ['<%= yeoman.app %>/scripts/{,*/}*.js', '!<%= yeoman.app %>/scripts/expresscontrollers/*.js', '!<%= yeoman.app %>/scripts/models/*.js', '!<%= yeoman.app %>/scripts/passport.js'],
    tasks: ['newer:jshint:all'],
    options: {
      livereload: true //'<%= connect.options.livereload %>'
    }
  },
  jsTest: {
    files: ['test/spec/{,*/}*.js'],
    tasks: ['newer:jshint:test', 'karma']
  },
  styles: {
    files: ['<%= yeoman.app %>/styles/{,*/}*.css'],
    tasks: ['newer:less', 'autoprefixer']
  },
  gruntfile: {
    files: ['Gruntfile.js']
  },
  recess: {
    files: ['<%= yeoman.app %>/styles/{,*/}*.less'],
    tasks: ['recess:dist']
  },

```


LESS
------------
This app uses the CSS pre-processor [LESS](http://lesscss.org/) in order to facilitate styling with [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/css/), which is included.  LESS files can be found in the styles folder under the app directory. (See Directory Structure section above to locate these).  In order for these files to be converted into CSS, and modify styling in the views, save LESS files within the styles folder.



Login/Register Feature
------------
The client-side files for user authentication, which are used in the [/] (https://github.com/carmenvkrol/blocitoff/blob/master/app/views/AuthView.html) view, are in the app directory within the public directory.  The server-side functionality is also in the app directory within the expresscontrollers folder.  (See Directory Structure section above to locate these).



Task Feature
------------
The client-side functionality for tasks, which are used in the [/tasks](https://github.com/carmenvkrol/blocitoff/blob/master/app/views/tasks.html) view, can be found in the app directory . The server-side functionality is also in the app directory within the expresscontrollers folder. (See Directory Structure section above to locate these).
